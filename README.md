Finite annual freshwater inventories are inadequate to meet stringently burgeoning human demand for water. In accordance with water diplomacy, this paper will present and propose the ways to deal with water scarcity by the means of desalination of seawater based upon discussions of existing scenarios of water scarcity and desalination at international and intranational levels along with their impact on human lives, their sufferings, and economy. This work also responds to myths that devoid desalination and gives a brief insight of desalination process that aims to formulate awareness in order to create a global freshwater security.
