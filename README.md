# Research Abstract

<b> “Water-Water everywhere not a single drop to drink”. </b> This accurately describes the dilemma of drought-affected areas all over the world with proximity to seas and oceans. Finite annual freshwater inventories are inadequate to meet stringently burgeoning human demand for water. In accordance with water diplomacy, this paper will present and propose the ways to deal with water scarcity by the means of desalination of seawater based upon discussions of existing scenarios of water scarcity and desalination at international and intranational levels along with their impact on human lives, their sufferings, and economy. This work also responds to myths that devoid desalination and gives a brief insight of desalination process that aims to formulate awareness in order to create a global freshwater security. 

In this paper, we present a novel empirical study of water-related questions from famous environment-related Q&A websites. Results show that in-spite of approximately constant number of water-related questions-posted from 2014-2017, the views on these questions are significantly decreasing. Prominent locations of water-related discussions are USA, Europe, Australia, and India. Most of the water-related questions discuss about oceanography and water-management.  Indian-users are observed to discuss solutions of their local water-related problems while no water-related discussion is observed from desalination-pioneers like Saudi-Arabia, Israel etc. Finite annual freshwater inventories are inadequate to meet stringently burgeoning human demand for water. To fathom desalination as a solution to water-scarcity by employing renewable energy, we draw a comparison of India and Saudi-Arabia and suggest desalination of sea-water as the sustainable solution for water-scarcity in regions with proximity to seas and oceans. This work also responds to myths that devoid desalination and aims to formulate awareness in order to create a global freshwater security.
